      "content_transcript": "This opening lecture lays the groundwork for the course by explaining what **data structures** and **algorithms** are and why they matter. Students learn that data structures are systematic ways to organize and store data, while algorithms are step-by-step procedures for performing tasks or solving problems using that data. We introduce the concept of **algorithmic efficiency**, discussing how different approaches to the same problem can vary widely in speed. A key tool for analyzing efficiency, **Big O notation**, is presented with simple examples. For instance, searching for an item in an unsorted list may take time proportional to the list size (linear time, *O(n)*), whereas using a more clever method on a sorted list can be much faster (*O(log n)* for binary search). We emphasize the importance of efficiency in scenarios where data sizes are large. The lecture also outlines the topics ahead: from basic structures like arrays and linked lists to more complex ones like trees and graphs, as well as fundamental algorithms for sorting and searching. By the end of this lecture, students grasp why choosing the right data structure and algorithm is crucial for writing high-performance programs. They also become familiar with terms like **time complexity** (how running time grows with input size) and **space complexity** (memory usage), setting the stage for deeper analysis in subsequent lectures.",

      "content_transcript": "In this lecture, we focus on the array data structure. **Arrays** are defined as a collection of elements identified by an index or key, stored in contiguous memory. Students learn how arrays allow constant time (*O(1)*) random access to elements by index, making retrieval very fast. We cover typical array operations such as traversal (visiting each element in sequence), update (changing an element at a given index), and searching. The lecture contrasts the efficiency of different operations: while reading or writing at a specific index is quick, inserting or deleting an element in the middle of an array can be costly since elements must be shifted to maintain contiguity (resulting in *O(n)* time for these operations). We also introduce the concept of **dynamic arrays** (like Python lists or ArrayLists in Java) which can resize themselves when they run out of space. Memory layout and the idea of contiguous storage are discussed, highlighting how arrays are stored in memory and how pointer arithmetic can be used to access array elements. By the end of this lecture, students will understand when arrays are an appropriate choice of data structure (e.g., when fast lookups by index are needed), and their limitations (such as a fixed size in static arrays or expensive insertions/deletions).",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture introduces the **singly linked list**, a fundamental dynamic data structure. Students learn that unlike arrays, linked lists consist of nodes that are linked together via pointers (or references). Each **node** in a singly linked list contains two parts: the data value and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. We start by visualizing a simple chain of nodes to illustrate how the list is structured in memory. Basic operations on linked lists are discussed and demonstrated. These include traversal (visiting each node by following the chain), insertion of a new node (at the head, tail, or middle of the list), and deletion of a node. We emphasize how these operations differ in cost from array operations: for instance, inserting at the head of a linked list is *O(1)* (just adjust a couple of pointers), whereas finding an insertion point in the middle is *O(n)* because the list must be traversed. Students see pseudocode and examples for adding and removing nodes, and learn about the importance of maintaining the **head** (starting point) of the list. Memory aspects are covered as well: nodes are typically allocated on the heap, and the links allow the list to grow or shrink dynamically. By the end of this session, students understand the advantages of linked lists (dynamic size, efficient insertions/deletions at ends) as well as their drawbacks (no constant-time random access, sequential access only).",

      "content_transcript": "Building on the concept of singly linked lists, this lecture explores **doubly linked lists** and **circular linked lists**. A doubly linked list extends the idea of a singly linked list by giving each node a pointer to both its next node and its previous node. This bidirectional linkage allows for easy traversal in both directions (forward and backward) and simplifies deletion operations since you can directly access a node’s predecessor. We discuss the structure of a typical node in a doubly linked list (data, next pointer, prev pointer) and walk through insertion and deletion algorithms. Students learn that while doubly linked lists offer more flexibility than singly linked lists, they use slightly more memory (an extra pointer per node) and require updating more pointers during insertion or deletion. Next, we introduce circular linked lists, where the last node’s next pointer points back to the first node, forming a circle. This structure is useful for scenarios where we want to cycle through data continuously (e.g., implementing a round-robin scheduler). We examine how traversal works in a circular list (careful to detect the stopping condition to avoid infinite loops) and how insertions and deletions are handled at the tail or head. By the end of the lecture, students can differentiate when to use singly vs doubly linked lists, understand the trade-offs involved, and recognize situations where a circular structure might be beneficial.",

Students see real-world scenarios where linked lists are suitable, such as implementing stacks and queues (which we will cover separately), navigating through browser history (back/forward links), or managing blocks of memory in an operating system. We also delve into how memory is allocated and freed for linked list nodes, covering concepts of **heap allocation** and the importance of proper deallocation (or how garbage collection handles it in languages like Java or Python). The lecture touches on the idea of **null** references and the need to check for null (or None) to avoid dereferencing a non-existent node—a common source of bugs. We discuss the cost of searching for data in a linked list (which is *O(n)* linear time, since we may have to scan node by node) and compare it to array searches. Students also learn how linked lists can be used to implement more complex data structures; for example, how a **linked list can serve as the foundation for a stack or queue** or how multiple linked lists can form adjacency lists in graph representations. By connecting the conceptual knowledge to practical applications, this lecture solidifies understanding of when a linked list is the right tool for a problem and prepares students to see how these lists integrate into larger structures.",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture introduces the **stack** abstract data type and its common implementations. A stack is a collection of elements that follows a Last-In-First-Out (**LIFO**) principle, meaning the last element added (pushed) to the stack is the first one to be removed (popped). Students learn about the two primary stack operations: `push` (to add an element to the top of the stack) and `pop` (to remove the element from the top), as well as the `peek` (or `top`) operation to view the top element without removing it. We discuss how stacks can be efficiently implemented using either arrays or linked lists. With an array, the top of the stack moves as we push or pop (taking care of potential overflow if the array is fixed-size). With a linked list, the head of the list can function as the top of the stack, allowing push and pop in constant time. The lecture explores several practical applications of stacks: from managing function calls and recursion (the call stack) to parsing and evaluating arithmetic expressions, and checking for balanced parentheses in code. We also cover scenarios such as undo operations in software (where recent actions are stored on a stack). Performance considerations are highlighted: stack operations are typically *O(1)*, making stacks very efficient for the appropriate tasks. By the end, students understand both how to use stack operations in algorithms and how to implement a stack data structure themselves.",

      "content_transcript": "In this lecture, we focus on the **queue** abstract data type, which operates on a First-In-First-Out (**FIFO**) principle: the first element enqueued (added) is the first to be dequeued (removed). Key operations of a queue are `enqueue` (to add an item to the back of the queue) and `dequeue` (to remove an item from the front of the queue), along with inspection operations like `front` (to peek at the first element). We examine two common implementations: using a linked list (where we keep pointers to both the head and tail to allow *O(1)* enqueue and dequeue operations) and using an array (often in a circular buffer fashion to efficiently reuse array space and avoid shifting elements). Real-world examples help illustrate queue usage: scheduling tasks in operating systems (the ready queue for processes), handling requests in web servers, or even everyday scenarios like people in line at a ticket counter. We also introduce a special kind of queue called a **deque** (double-ended queue), which allows insertion and removal at both ends, bridging stack and queue functionality. By comparing and contrasting with stacks, students learn how queues are suited for breadth-first processing of data (for instance, breadth-first search in graphs uses a queue) and appreciate the importance of choosing the right data structure to manage ordering constraints in various algorithms.",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture marks the transition to non-linear data structures by introducing **trees**. We begin with the definition of a tree as a hierarchical structure composed of nodes, where each node may have children nodes linked in a parent-child relationship. Important terminology is established: **root** (the top node with no parent), **leaf** (a node with no children), **internal node** (node with at least one child), **edge** (connection between parent and child), **height** of a tree (the number of edges on the longest downward path from the root to a leaf), and **depth** of a node (distance from the root). We pay particular attention to **binary trees**, a specific type of tree where each node has at most two children (often referred to as left and right child). Binary trees are the foundation for many more advanced structures. Using diagrams, we explore examples of small trees, showing how data can be organized hierarchically (for instance, a family genealogy or a file directory structure). We also discuss the concept of an **empty tree** (null) and how recursion naturally fits tree definitions (a tree is a value with subtrees as children). The lecture sets up why trees are useful, foreshadowing how they allow efficient searching and sorting of data when organized properly (leading into binary search trees in a later lecture). By the end, students are comfortable with basic tree concepts and vocabulary, forming a basis for understanding tree algorithms and operations.",

      "content_transcript": "In this lecture, students learn how to systematically visit all nodes in a tree through **tree traversal algorithms**. We cover the primary depth-first traversal methods for binary trees: **pre-order**, **in-order**, and **post-order** traversal. For each method, we explain the visitation order with an example binary tree: - In **pre-order** traversal, a node is visited before its children (visit node, then traverse left subtree, then right subtree). - In **in-order** traversal, for binary search trees in particular, visiting the left subtree, then the node, then the right subtree yields sorted order of elements. - In **post-order** traversal, a node is visited after all of its children (traverse left, traverse right, then visit node). We demonstrate these traversals with a sample tree, showing the sequence of nodes visited. Students see recursive algorithms for each traversal and trace through them to understand how the call stack processes nodes. Additionally, we mention **level-order traversal** (breadth-first traversal) which visits nodes level by level from the root downwards, often implemented using a queue. By comparing the different traversal orders, students learn how the same tree can be processed in multiple ways depending on the algorithm. This knowledge is important, for example, in tree-based computations or serializing trees. By the end of this lecture, students can write and trace traversal algorithms, and they understand why different traversals are useful (such as in-order for sorted output of a BST).",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture focuses on **binary search trees (BSTs)**, a special kind of binary tree that maintains a sorted order among its elements. We define the BST property: for any node, all values in its left subtree are smaller than the node’s value, and all values in its right subtree are greater. Students learn how this invariant enables efficient searching: one can determine which direction to continue (left or right) by a single comparison at each node, achieving an average time complexity of *O(log n)* for search, insertion, and deletion when the tree is balanced. We illustrate how to search for a value in a BST by traversing down left or right pointers based on comparisons. Next, we cover how to insert a new value into a BST, ensuring the property remains intact, and conceptually how deletion is handled (with the three cases: deleting a leaf, deleting a node with one child, and deleting a node with two children by finding an in-order successor or predecessor). The lecture also addresses the shape of BSTs: in the best case (or with self-balancing techniques, which are beyond our scope here) the tree remains balanced, but in the worst case (inserting already sorted data, for example) the BST can degenerate into a linked list with *O(n)* performance. We emphasize the need for balance and mention that advanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees exist to maintain efficiency (pointing out these are advanced topics not covered in detail). By the end, students will understand how BSTs combine the concepts of sorting and tree structures to allow quick data lookup, and they will be able to perform and trace insertions and searches on a BST.",

      "content_transcript": "Moving beyond tree structures, this lecture introduces **graphs** as a powerful and general data structure for modeling relationships between pairs of objects. We define a graph as a set of **vertices** (also called nodes) connected by **edges**. Edges can be either directed (having a direction from one vertex to another) or undirected (bi-directional connection). Key terminology is established: **adjacency** (when two vertices are connected by an edge), **degree** of a vertex (number of edges incident to it, with distinction between in-degree and out-degree in directed graphs), and special types of graphs (like weighted graphs where edges carry weights or costs). We discuss two primary ways to represent graphs in a computer: **adjacency matrices** (a 2D matrix indicating connections between every pair of vertices) and **adjacency lists** (each vertex has a list of its neighboring vertices). The trade-offs are explained: adjacency matrices allow constant-time checks if an edge exists but use more space (*O(V^2)*), whereas adjacency lists are memory-efficient (*O(V + E)* space) and faster to iterate over neighbors. Examples of graphs from real life are given: social networks (people as vertices, friendships as edges), city maps (intersections as vertices, roads as edges), or the web (web pages and hyperlinks). We also introduce the concept of **connectivity** (whether all vertices are reachable from each other or if the graph is broken into components) and **cycles** (a path that starts and ends at the same vertex). By the end of this lecture, students should be comfortable with the core concepts of graph theory and how to represent a graph in code, setting up the stage for exploring graph traversal algorithms.",

      "content_transcript": "In this lecture, we cover fundamental algorithms for traversing or searching through graphs: **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. We start with DFS, explaining how this strategy goes deep into a graph by exploring a path fully before backtracking. DFS can be implemented recursively or with an explicit stack. Students see how DFS uses a stack (either the call stack or a manual stack structure) to remember vertices to explore. We discuss the concept of marking vertices as **visited** to avoid infinite loops in cycles. Next, we explore BFS, which takes a level-by-level approach. Using a queue, BFS starts at a source vertex and explores all immediate neighbors first, then moves to the next level of neighbors. This approach naturally finds the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from the start vertex to any other reachable vertex in an unweighted graph, which we highlight as a key difference from DFS. We walk through an example graph with both algorithms: showing the order in which nodes are visited in DFS vs BFS. This helps students visually grasp the contrasting patterns of exploration. Additionally, we mention typical uses: DFS is useful for tasks like detecting cycles or performing topological sorts, while BFS is used for shortest path in unweighted scenarios or for finding all nodes within `k` steps from a source. By the end of the lecture, students can hand-trace DFS and BFS on a graph, understand their time complexity (*O(V+E)* for both), and know scenarios where one might be preferred over the other.",

We introduce the concept of **topological sorting** as an application of DFS in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Students learn that a topological sort produces an ordering of vertices such that all directed edges go from earlier in the order to later, which is useful for scheduling problems (e.g., ordering tasks given precedence constraints). We also touch on **shortest path problems**, explaining that while BFS finds shortest paths in terms of edge count, weighted graphs require algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm (which is mentioned conceptually but left as an advanced topic outside the scope of this introductory course). Another graph concept introduced is the **minimum spanning tree** (briefly describing what it means to connect all vertices with the minimum total edge weight, solved by algorithms like Kruskal’s or Prim’s, again noted as advanced). Throughout the lecture, practical examples are used to ground these concepts: for instance, scheduling course prerequisites can be modeled as a DAG to be topologically sorted, or finding the fastest route on a map corresponds to a shortest path computation. We wrap up our coverage of graphs by summarizing how powerful the graph model is, capable of representing complex relationships, and emphasizing that many real-world problems can be translated into graph terms. Students come away with an appreciation for the breadth of graph applications and a roadmap of more advanced algorithms they might encounter in further studies.",

We define recursion as a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. The lecture covers the two critical components of any recursive solution: the **base case** (a simple instance of the problem that can be answered directly) and the **recursive case** (the part of the function where it calls itself on a smaller subproblem). We illustrate recursion with classic examples: computing the factorial of a number (n! = n * (n-1)!), the Fibonacci sequence, and simple list processing (like summing an array of numbers recursively by summing the tail and adding the first element). Students learn to trace recursive calls, seeing how each call adds a layer to the call stack, and how returning unwinds the stack. We discuss the concept of the **call stack** and how recursion uses stack frames for each call, highlighting the risk of infinite recursion if a base case is not properly defined (leading to a stack overflow). We also compare recursive solutions with iterative ones, noting that some problems that are easy to solve with recursion (like traversing a tree or solving the Towers of Hanoi puzzle) can be more complex to implement iteratively. By the end of the lecture, students have a solid understanding of how recursion works, when it is advantageous to use, and how to approach writing a recursive algorithm.",

      "content_transcript": "Building on the basics of recursion, this lecture explores how recursive thinking applies to data structures and more complex problem-solving. We start by revisiting tree traversals (from Week 4) with a fresh perspective: understanding that functions for traversing a binary tree (pre-order, in-order, post-order) are inherently recursive. Students now see how these algorithms naturally fit the recursive paradigm, processing a node and then recursively its subtrees. We then examine another classic recursive scenario: **divide-and-conquer** algorithms. The concept is introduced through the example of merge sort (to be covered in detail later) or computing powers of a number (where we can recursively compute half the power). Students also learn about using recursion for **backtracking** – a strategy for exploring possibilities, such as solving a maze or the N-Queens chess problem, by trying a path and backtracking when a dead end is reached. This demonstrates the power of recursion in simplifying complex exploratory algorithms. We emphasize how certain data structures are naturally operated on with recursion (for example, graphs with DFS can use recursion). The lecture also covers strategies to convert recursive algorithms to iterative ones with the help of an explicit stack, reinforcing the relationship between recursion and stack data structures. By the end of this session, students appreciate recursion not just as a concept but as a practical tool. They gain insight into recognizing problems that lend themselves to recursive solutions and ensuring efficiency and correctness when implementing them.",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture introduces fundamental **searching algorithms** that operate on collections of data. We begin with **linear search**, the simplest approach, where we iterate through the elements of a list or array one by one to find a target value. Students note that linear search runs in *O(n)* time because in the worst case it might check every element. We then contrast this with **binary search**, a much faster method for finding an element in a sorted array. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half: it compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are not equal, it decides whether to continue with the left half or right half of the array, eliminating half of the remaining elements at each step. This yields a time complexity of *O(log n)*, which is a dramatic improvement over linear search for large datasets. Through examples, we demonstrate how binary search zeroes in on a target quickly—e.g., guessing a number between 1 and 100 by halving the range at each guess, versus checking numbers sequentially. We also discuss the requirement that data must be sorted for binary search to work correctly, and what implications that has (the cost of sorting beforehand if data isn't sorted). Edge cases are covered, such as what happens if the element is not present (binary search eventually narrows to an empty range) and ensuring the algorithm handles even and odd sized arrays correctly. By the end, students understand when each search technique is appropriate: linear search for small or unsorted collections and binary search for sorted arrays where quick lookups are needed.",

      "content_transcript": "In this first part of our exploration of sorting, we cover several simple **sorting algorithms**: **bubble sort**, **selection sort**, and **insertion sort**. These algorithms are intuitive and easy to understand, though not the most efficient for large data sets. We begin with **bubble sort**, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. With each pass through the array, the largest remaining element \"bubbles up\" to its correct position at the end. Students see that while bubble sort is simple, it has a worst-case time complexity of *O(n^2)*, making it impractical for very large lists. Next, we look at **selection sort**, which sorts by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it to the beginning. We walk through an example, selecting the smallest element and swapping it with the first element, then repeating for the next position. Selection sort also operates in *O(n^2)* time, but it makes fewer swaps than bubble sort. Then we introduce **insertion sort**, which builds the sorted array one element at a time by taking each new element and inserting it into the correct position among those already sorted. We liken this to the way one might sort a hand of playing cards, inserting each new card into the correct position relative to the ones in hand. Insertion sort is *O(n^2)* in the worst case but can perform much better (*O(n)*) on nearly sorted data, which we highlight as a strength. Throughout the lecture, students get to see these algorithms in action with step-by-step examples and are encouraged to manually simulate them on small lists to grasp their mechanics. We also compare their practical performance and stability (whether equal elements maintain their original order, e.g., insertion sort and bubble sort are stable, selection sort is not necessarily stable).",

      "content_transcript": "Continuing with sorting algorithms, this lecture examines more efficient approaches: **quick sort** and **merge sort**, which are both classic examples of the divide-and-conquer paradigm. First, we introduce **merge sort**. Students learn how merge sort divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then **merges** the sorted halves together. We illustrate the merging process with an example, showing how two sorted sublists can be efficiently combined into one sorted list by repeatedly taking the smallest front element from either sublist. Merge sort guarantees a running time of *O(n log n)* in all cases, and we discuss its space trade-off (it requires additional memory for merging). Next, we discuss **quick sort**, an efficient in-place sort. Quick sort works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around that pivot: all elements smaller than the pivot are moved to its left, and all larger elements to its right. Then the algorithm recursively sorts the left and right partitions. We explain that the choice of pivot affects performance: in the average case quick sort runs in *O(n log n)*, but in the worst case (e.g., pivot is always the smallest or largest element) it can degrade to *O(n^2)*. However, with a good pivot strategy (like picking a median or random element), worst-case scenarios are rare. We compare quick sort and merge sort, noting that quick sort is often faster in practice due to low constants and cache-friendly accesses, even though merge sort has the benefit of guaranteed performance. We also mention that merge sort is stable (preserves order of equal elements) whereas quick sort is not necessarily stable. By the end of this lecture, students understand how dividing a problem (sorting) into smaller subproblems can lead to highly efficient solutions, and they are aware of the complexity and use-cases of two of the most important sorting algorithms in computing.",

Students learn that a well-designed hash table can achieve average-case constant time *O(1)* complexity for insert, lookup, and delete operations, making it incredibly powerful for tasks like dictionary word lookups or caching. We break down the components of a hash table: the **hash function** (which should distribute keys uniformly across the array indices), the handling of **collisions** (situations where two distinct keys produce the same hash index), and the typical size of the underlying array. Collision resolution strategies are discussed: **separate chaining** (where each array index points to a linked list of entries that hash to that index) and **open addressing** (where collisions are resolved by probing for the next empty slot, with techniques like linear probing or quadratic probing). We give examples of how hash tables are used in practice (e.g., implementing a dictionary data type in Python or an unordered_map in C++). Students see how insertion works (compute hash, index, place entry) and how to handle lookup (compute hash and search at that index). We also touch on the concept of the **load factor** (the ratio of number of entries to table size) and how performance can degrade if the table gets too full, often mitigated by resizing the table and rehashing. By lecture’s end, students appreciate the efficiency of hash tables and understand both their strength (fast operations) and their caveats (need for good hash functions and handling collisions).",

      "content_transcript": "This lecture introduces the concept of **heaps**, with a focus on **binary heaps**, and their application in **priority queues**. A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the *heap property*: in a max-heap, each node’s value is greater than or equal to the values of its children (in a min-heap, each node’s value is less than or equal to its children). We explain how a binary heap is commonly implemented using an array, where index relationships (parent and child indices) allow navigation as if it were a complete binary tree. Students learn how this implementation is memory efficient and cache-friendly. Core heap operations are covered: `insert` (adding a new element and “heapifying” up to maintain the property) and `extract` (removing the root element—the maximum in a max-heap or minimum in a min-heap—and then “heapifying” down to reorder). Both operations have a time complexity of *O(log n)* due to the tree height. We discuss the use case of heaps as **priority queues**, where elements have priorities and the highest priority element is always removed first. Examples include scheduling jobs by priority, managing events in a simulation, or Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths (where a min-heap is used to pick the next closest vertex). Students see a visual example of a heap being built from an unsorted array and how the heap property is maintained through successive insertions or removals. We also mention the concept of **heap sort**, which uses a heap to sort an array in *O(n log n)* time as an additional practical application. By the end of this lecture, students understand how heaps operate and why they are useful whenever a \"highest (or lowest) priority first\" retrieval is needed efficiently.",

      "content_transcript": "In the final lecture of the course, we review the key concepts and data structures covered throughout the 8 weeks, and offer a glimpse into more advanced topics that lie beyond. We start with a high-level recap: summarizing arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, recursion techniques, and algorithmic strategies for searching and sorting. This helps reinforce how each structure or algorithm is distinct, when to use them, and how they interrelate (for example, how trees and graphs allow hierarchical and network representations, or how recursion ties into algorithms like DFS and quick sort). We then transition to discuss what comes next after mastering these fundamentals. Students are introduced to advanced data structures like **balanced binary search trees** (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees) which ensure operations remain efficient by maintaining tree balance automatically. We also mention **graph algorithms** beyond basics, such as algorithms for shortest paths (Dijkstra’s algorithm) or network flows, to show the breadth of graph theory applications. Additionally, we highlight **advanced algorithmic paradigms** like dynamic programming and greedy algorithms that build on the base of understanding data structures and complexity. For data structures, we may briefly introduce **Tries** (prefix trees for string handling) or **Union-Find** (disjoint set union) as examples of specialized structures for particular problems. The lecture ends with advice on how to continue learning: practicing problem-solving on platforms, implementing these structures from scratch to solidify understanding, and taking more advanced courses in algorithms. By concluding with this birds-eye view and forward-looking perspective, students are reminded of how far they’ve come and are inspired to delve deeper into the field of data structures and algorithms.",
