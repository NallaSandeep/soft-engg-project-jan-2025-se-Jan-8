WEEK 5 (Very Importa)
===============
#Logic basics
Focus on definations

Predicate and clauses
Truth Table
 *If empty consider False
Satisfiable, valid and tautology
 * Givne predicate identify whether satisfiable, valid, tautology etc

#Logic Covergae Algorithm
when a particular clause will be come a determinant (XOR)

#Logic Coverage Criteria (v Imp)
Logic Coverage critieria CHART
Not much theorital questino but calculations are expected

Making a clause determine a predicate

E.g. what is GACC given variable
e.g. given truth table answer questinos
GACC
CACC
RACC
ACC
ICC

given conditionatla predicate
find correct otpion to fulfill test coverage for clause / predicate 

how many test cases for combinatorial covergae (2^n)

combinatinoal covergae
multiple combinational coverage

a predicate p with n clauses has 2^n possible assignment of truth values
Active & non active clauses

#Logic Sourec Code
One specific type of qustion
e.g. given clauses find Pa
There is a GA qustion given a program find GACC,RACC. Simple program
a small function with a few lins with some predicate conditions (if/else)
find Coverage (e.g RACC)
check GA



WEEK 6 (NOT TOO MUCH)
#Logic FSM (not that important)

given some form identify CNF,DNF,None
some theoritcal may come

#logic-source-code2
similart to preivous one.
translate to predicate
check for test cases for RACC etc

#Logic Specificaiton
recognize the form whehter CNF or DNF

#SMT-Solvers (not very important)
Theoritical only. Some defination based qustins


WEEK 7: (standard qustions GA)
#Symbolic Testing (V IMP)
Code is given, questions will be like
in spefifcic line, what are the PC conditions.
or find test case for which we get the errror
or find test caess that coever all 4 flows

Symbolic covergae is important
Theory is important
all definatinos (blue/red)
PC Values

some program is given and find symbolic condition
or for which symbolic condition it will reach...

Symbolic Execution Tree is not asked
Loop testing
 * e.g what condietion will hvae true values
 

#DART (not too important)
Theoritical qustion
Presentatino is important
(comma is used instead)
Definations are important
How to prepresent the DART equstion is only important

WEEK 8: (IMPORTANT)
#FUNCTIONAL TESTING
Type of functuional testing

All are important but these two are more
Decision tables
Random testing

Equivalence class partionining

Bounderay Value Analysis*
We do a bit differently. Just follow the slide example, not internet.

Decision tables: defination is important

Random testing: learn defination

#ISP (IMP)
Partitinls and Charecteristics
Given some program,criteria
what is the partition
or given a parition whehter it is disjoint or complete partition
 
Identifying values** important slide
Combination strategies criteria
All combination
each choice 
base choicse
Only these (ACoC,ECC,BCC)
Defination for all 

Base coverage is important
base case should be given
carefully check whether all is akked (includineg or exlcuding base input)

#Software Requirments
Read the theory
Given an example  identify 
reuiqirement
