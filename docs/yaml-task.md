# YAML API Documentation Task

## Overview
We need to crate an OpenAPI (YAML) documentation for the StudyHub and StudyIndexer microservices. The goal was to create accurate API documentation that reflects the actual implementation of both services, ensuring all endpoints are properly documented with their parameters, request bodies, and responses.

## Services Documented

### 1. StudyHub API
The StudyHub API is a Flask-based service that provides endpoints for managing the educational platform. The documentation was created in `studyhub-api.yaml`.

#### Modules Documented:
- **Authentication (`auth.py`)**: User registration, login, token verification, and password reset endpoints.
- **Courses (`courses.py`)**: Course management, enrollment, and week management endpoints.
- **Assignments (`assignments.py`)**: Assignment creation, retrieval, updating, and submission endpoints.
- **Users (`users.py`)**: User profile management, user listing, and account activation/deactivation endpoints.
- **Resources (`resources.py`)**: Course resource management, including creation, retrieval, updating, and downloading.
- **Question Bank (`question_bank.py`)**: Question management for assessments, including batch operations.
- **Personal Knowledge Base (`personal.py`)**: Personal knowledge base and folder management endpoints.
- **Admin Dashboard (`admin.py`)**: Administrative dashboard statistics endpoint.

### 2. StudyIndexer API
The StudyIndexer API is a FastAPI-based service that provides document indexing and semantic search capabilities. The documentation was created in `studyindexer-api.yaml`.

#### Modules Documented:
- **Documents (`documents.py`)**: Document uploading, indexing, retrieval, and management endpoints.
- **Admin (`admin.py`)**: Administrative endpoints for document management and system statistics.
- **Search (`search.py`)**: Semantic search and document similarity endpoints.
- **Personal (`personal.py`)**: Personal document management, metadata, and related document endpoints.

## Documentation Structure
Each YAML file follows the OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification and includes:

1. **API Information**: Title, description, and version.
2. **Server Configuration**: Base URL for the API.
3. **Security Schemes**: JWT Bearer authentication.
4. **Schemas**: Data models used in requests and responses.
5. **Paths**: Detailed endpoint documentation including:
   - HTTP method
   - Summary and description
   - Request parameters (path, query, header)
   - Request body schema (when applicable)
   - Response codes and descriptions
   - Security requirements

## Implementation Approach
The documentation was created by:
1. Examining the actual code implementation of each endpoint
2. Identifying the route paths, HTTP methods, and authentication requirements
3. Documenting request parameters, body schemas, and possible response codes
4. Ensuring consistency across all endpoints within each service
5. Organizing endpoints by logical grouping (tags)

## Validation
The documentation was created to be compatible with standard OpenAPI tooling and can be used with:
- API documentation viewers (Swagger UI, ReDoc)
- Code generation tools
- API testing tools

## Future Maintenance
As the APIs evolve, the YAML documentation should be updated to reflect changes in:
- New endpoints
- Modified request/response structures
- Deprecated functionality
- Authentication requirements

This documentation serves as a single source of truth for the API interfaces of both services, facilitating integration, testing, and client development.
