# FAQ Database Implementation: Development Status

## Current Status (2025-03-27)

The FAQ Database component of the StudyIndexer system has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- **Core Functionality**: Able to store, search, and retrieve FAQ items with semantic similarity ranking
- **API Endpoints**: Implemented all planned endpoints including search, add, update, delete, and import
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Successfully integrated with ChromaDB for vector storage and similarity search
- **Embedding Model**: Using all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384 dimensions) for generating embeddings
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing completed including edge cases and filter combinations

## Findings and Issues

### Issue 1: Zero Similarity Scores

**Problem**: All search results were returning with a similarity score of 0, which prevented any results from being returned when `min_score` was set above 0.

**Root Cause**: The implementation was not correctly converting ChromaDB distance scores to similarity scores. The distances from ChromaDB represent vector distances (where smaller means more similar), but we needed to convert these to similarity scores (where larger means more similar).

**Resolution**: Modified the search function in `faq.py` to properly convert distance to similarity using the formula: `similarity = (2 - distance) / 2`. This results in scores between 0 and 1, where 1 is a perfect match.

```python
# For each result from ChromaDB
similarity = (2 - distance) / 2  # Convert distance to similarity
```

### Issue 2: Duplicate Records

**Finding**: The current implementation allows duplicate content to be inserted as long as they have different IDs. This is because we generate UUIDs for each record rather than using content-based identifiers.

**Potential Solution**: Add a content similarity check before insertion to detect near-duplicates. This would use the same embedding and similarity calculation used for search.

### Issue 3: Filter Combinations

**Finding**: Multiple filters (tags, topic, source) use AND semantics for filtering, while within the tags array, items use OR semantics.

## Edge Case Testing Results

### 1. Basic Search (Successful)

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "graduation requirements",
  "limit": 5,
  "min_score": 0.3
}
```

**Result**: 5 results returned with scores ranging from 0.63 to 0.43.

### 2. Empty Query (Returns All Documents)

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "",
  "limit": 10,
  "min_score": 0
}
```

**Result**: 10 results returned, each with a score of 0 (as expected for non-semantic matching).

### 3. Very High Min Score (No Results)

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "credit requirements",
  "limit": 5,
  "min_score": 0.95
}
```

**Result**: 0 results returned, which is expected as very few queries would achieve a 0.95+ similarity score.

### 4. Limit Validation

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "exam",
  "limit": 1000,
  "min_score": 0.3
}
```

**Result**: Proper validation error returned, limiting the maximum results to 50.

### 5. Multiple Tag Filter

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "eligibility",
  "limit": 10,
  "min_score": 0.3,
  "tags": ["graduation", "admission"]
}
```

**Result**: 0 results returned in this test case, indicating tags are combined with OR logic but no match was found.

### 6. Compound Filters

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "requirements",
  "limit": 10,
  "min_score": 0.3,
  "topic": "Eligibility Criteria",
  "source": "student_handbook"
}
```

**Result**: 10 results returned, all matching both the topic and source filters.

### 7. All Filters Combined (No Matches)

**Request**:
```json
{
  "query": "credit",
  "limit": 15,
  "min_score": 0.2,
  "tags": ["graduation"],
  "topic": "Eligibility Criteria",
  "source": "student_handbook"
}
```

**Result**: 0 results returned, as no documents matched all filter criteria.

## Embedding Service Verification

The embedding service was verified to be working correctly:
- Consistently using "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model across the application
- Embeddings have the correct 384 dimensions
- Same embedding service instance used for both adding and searching
- Consistent preprocessing applied to all texts

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Duplicate Prevention**:
   - Add similarity check before insertion to prevent near-duplicates
   - Consider content hashing for exact duplicates

2. **Enhanced Filtering**:
   - Add explicit AND/OR operators for tag combinations
   - Support date range filtering (created_after, updated_before)
   - Add multiple topic/source support similar to tags

3. **Pagination**:
   - Implement offset/skip parameters for improved browsing of large result sets

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add caching for frequent queries
   - Implement batch processing for large import operations

## Next Tasks

1. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update API documentation with filter behavior details
   - Document embedding model choices and parameters

2. **Duplicate Detection**:
   - Implement similarity check during import/add operations
   - Add configuration option to control duplicate threshold

3. **Extended Filter Options**:
   - Add date-based filtering
   - Implement complex filter expressions
   - Add result sorting options

4. **Integration**:
   - Complete integration with the other vector databases
   - Verify interaction with the chat interface
