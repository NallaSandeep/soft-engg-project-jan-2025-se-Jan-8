# CourseContent Implementation Summary

We have successfully implemented the CourseContent feature in the StudyIndexerNew project. This feature allows for storing, retrieving, and managing detailed course content with support for embedded search.

## Key Components

1. **Data Models**:
   - `CourseInfo`: Basic course information (ID, code, title, etc.)
   - `CourseTopic`: Topics covered in the course
   - `Week`: Weekly breakdown of course content
   - `Lecture`: Detailed lecture information
   - `CourseContent`: Complete course content model

2. **Services**:
   - `CourseContentService`: Core service for managing course content with ChromaDB

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - POST `/api/v1/course-content`: Add new course content
   - GET `/api/v1/course-content/{course_id}`: Get course content by ID
   - PUT `/api/v1/course-content/{course_id}`: Update course content
   - DELETE `/api/v1/course-content/{course_id}`: Delete course content
   - GET `/api/v1/course-content`: List all courses
   - GET `/api/v1/course-content/search`: Search for courses by query
   - POST `/api/v1/course-content/import`: Import course content from JSON files

4. **Development-only Features**:
   - POST `/api/v1/course-content/import-sample`: Import sample courses (disabled in production)

## Integration with Other Services

The CourseContent feature is designed to work with the CourseSelector feature, providing detailed course information that can be referenced by the StudyIndexer system. It ensures that:

1. Course IDs are consistent with the StudyHub system
2. Week and lecture information follows a consistent structure
3. Topic and concept information is indexed for semantic search

## Sample JSON Request

Here's an example of a valid JSON request for creating a new course:

```json
{
  "course_info": {
    "course_id": "ML401",
    "code": "ML401",
    "title": "Machine Learning Fundamentals",
    "description": "Introduction to machine learning concepts, algorithms, and practical applications.",
    "department": "Computer Science",
    "credits": 4
  },
  "topics": [
    {
      "name": "Supervised Learning",
      "description": "Learning from labeled data for classification and regression tasks",
      "week": 2,
      "importance": 10
    },
    {
      "name": "Unsupervised Learning",
      "description": "Finding patterns in unlabeled data",
      "week": 4,
      "importance": 8
    }
  ],
  "concepts_covered": [
    "Data preprocessing",
    "Feature engineering",
    "Model training"
  ],
  "concepts_not_covered": [
    "Deep reinforcement learning",
    "Generative AI"
  ],
  "weeks": [
    {
      "order": 1,
      "title": "Introduction to Machine Learning",
      "description": "Overview of machine learning types and applications",
      "is_published": true
    }
  ],
  "lectures": [
    {
      "title": "What is Machine Learning?",
      "week": 1,
      "order": 1,
      "content_type": "video",
      "url": "https://example.com/ml401/intro",
      "transcript": "Machine learning is a field...",
      "is_published": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Course

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/v1/course-content' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "course_info": {
      "course_id": "ML401",
      "code": "ML401",
      "title": "Machine Learning Fundamentals",
      "description": "Introduction to machine learning concepts...",
      ...
    },
    ...
  }'
```

### Searching for Courses

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/v1/course-content/search?query=machine+learning&limit=10'
```

### Getting Course Details

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/v1/course-content/ML401'
```

## Testing

The provided test script `test_course_content.py` demonstrates how to:

1. Load sample courses from JSON files
2. List all courses in the database
3. Search for courses using different queries
4. Retrieve detailed course information

## Future Improvements

1. Add pagination for course listings
2. Add filtering options for course search (department, credits, etc.)
3. Add support for course content versioning
4. Add bulk course content updates
5. Integrate with StudyHub for automatic course content synchronization
