CourseGuide Service for StudyIndexerNew

This service handles personalized learning pathways and content recommendations
for students based on their learning goals and current progress.

Core Functions:
- Recommending relevant content based on learning goals
- Generating personalized learning paths
- Finding related content across courses
- Assessing content difficulty based on student profile
