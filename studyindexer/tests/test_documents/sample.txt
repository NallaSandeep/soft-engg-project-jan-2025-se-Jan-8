This is a sample document for testing the StudyIndexer service.

The document contains multiple paragraphs to test the text splitting functionality.
Each paragraph should be processed into chunks based on the configured size and overlap settings.

This paragraph contains information about machine learning concepts.
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks.
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multiple layers of neural networks.

Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning.
These embeddings allow us to perform similarity searches and find related content.
The StudyIndexer service uses these embeddings to power its search functionality.
